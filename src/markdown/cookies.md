# Cookie Policy

With this Cookie Policy, I inform you about the use of cookies and other similar storage technologies (hereafter called "Cookies") on this website.

## What are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed by the browser of your device to store specific information. When revisiting this website with the same machine, the data stored in the Cookies will either be sent back to this website ("First Party Cookies") or to another website to which the Cookie belongs ("Third Party Cookies").

Through the stored and sent back information, the respective website detects that you have previously visited it before with the browser of your device. I use this information to design and display the site optimally to you according to your preferences. During this process, only the Cookie itself is identified on your device. Storage of personal data exceeding this only takes place after you have provided your explicit consent or if this is strictly necessary for enabling you the use of the service you requested.

## Consent to the use of Cookies

Cookies that are not strictly necessary to provide the services on this website will only be used after you have given your consent to their use. As soon as you use this website actively, you give your permission to the use of Cookies.

For more information on how to generally disable Cookies on your browser (including Strictly Necessary Cookies), please see the documentation or manual of your browser.

## Types of Cookies

Depending on its purpose and function, Cookies are divided into the following categories:

- Strictly Necessary Cookies;
- Functional Cookies;
- Performance Cookies; and
- Marketing Cookies

### Strictly Necessary Cookies

Strictly Necessary Cookies secure specific functions, without which you would not be able to use this website as intended. These Cookies are First Party Cookie, as they are only used and set by this website. All information, which is stored in the Cookies, is sent back to this website.

Strictly Necessary Cookies are used for instance to keep you logged in as a user when accessing different sub-sites of a website so that you do not have to log-in every time you access a new site.

The use of Strictly Necessary Cookies on this website is possible without your consent. Therefore, Strictly Necessary Cookies cannot be separately activated or deactivated. This function is only available for Cookies that require your prior consent, thus Functional, Performance and Marketing Cookies.

However, you will always have the possibility to generally deactivate all Cookies in your browser settings.

### Functional Cookies

Functional Cookies enable this website to store information previously provided by you (such as registered name or selected language) and to offer you improved and personalized features based thereon. These Cookies only collect and store anonymized information, so that they cannot track your movements on other websites.

### Performance Cookies

Performance Cookies collect information on how this website is used for me to improve its appeal, content, and functionality. These Cookies help me determine, for example, which sub-sites of this website are accessed and what material the users are most interested in. In particular, I register the number of access to each site and sub-sites, the time spent on this website, the sequence of the sites visited, which search terms led you here, the country, region, and city from which the website is accessed as well as the proportion of mobile devices accessing this website.

As a consequence, I can adjust the content of this website to meet the specific needs of all visitors and optimize this service. IP addresses, which have to be transmitted due to technical reasons, are automatically anonymized, and therefore no link to individual users may be drawn.

### Marketing Cookies / Third Party Cookies

Marketing Cookies are set by external advertising companies (Third Party Cookies) and will be used to gather information about the user’s visited websites to create targeted advertising to the user.

## Administration and deletion of cookies

Furthermore, you may change the settings of your internet browser to prevent the storage of Cookies on your device in general or that you will be asked every time, whether you agree to the setting and use of Cookies. Cookies that have been set once can also be deleted at any time. How all this works in detail can be found in your browser’s help function.

Please note that a general deactivation of the use of Cookies might lead to a restriction of this website´s functionality.
